# CS 5311/4331 â€“ Programming with R for Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Assignment 2: The one-stop PCA Center

### 2. In this question you will demonstrate your understanding of PCA and eigen faces. Your work will involve a mix of applying knowledge acquired in the classroom and researching about the shiny library in R. You will use shiny for this assignment. You will build a dashboard that will be able to support the following:
   #### a. Enables one to do PCA, supply any needed data and inputs, configure and reconfigure things, and visualize results. 
  
  <b>Answer:</b>
  
    - Open PCA.R file and run app.
    - Now browse a numerical dataset and hit enter.
    - Choose the respective tabs to see the data such as PCA, Eigen Values, Eigen Vectors, etc.
    
    or
    
    - You can also click on BruteForce.R and run which is only designed for "iris.csv" dataset.
    
  #### b. Enables one to undertake eigen faces based classification on a bunch of faces. Again, it should enable one to supply any needed data and inputs, configure and reconfigure the system, and visualize results.
  
  <b>Answer:</b>
  
    - First open <em>eigenface_dataset.py</em> and run the program in python to get the datasets.
    - The obtained datasets will be stored in the same folder.
    - Now open the <em>eigenfaces.R</em> and run the program which uses the downloaded datasets and produces the result.
